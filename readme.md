## We've got an API!
We'll use this as a plugin installed to various builds to ship data to projects we're working on.

## Things to know
Built with node.js, mongoDB, and Express - as well as various dependencies we've got in our package. Required to have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed on your system as well as [mongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/). You can install both via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

## To Start
Clone this repository to a folder, enter the folder and do the following:
```npm install```
```nodemon server.js```
